## Introduction
In today's data-driven world, businesses have access to vast amounts of data that can
provide valuable insights into consumer behavior and preferences. However, working with large
and complex datasets can be a daunting task, requiring specialized skills and tools. In this
context, we were tasked with exploring three massive datasets from a streaming app and
extracting relevant information from them. Our objective was to take a sample from the datasets
and identify the most popular shows among them, as well as any commonalities between them.
To achieve this, we used the powerful data analysis tools R and Tableau, which enabled us to
conduct exploratory data analysis and derive meaningful insights from the data. The datasets we
worked with were collected by NBCUniversal through their old iOS streaming app and contain
information about user viewing habits across different brands. However, before we could analyze
the data, we had to clean it first, a crucial step in any data analysis process.

## Methodology
The methodology we followed to extract insights from the three large datasets provided
involved several steps. Firstly, we selected the first 100,000 rows from each dataset to create a
manageable sample size for analysis. We then removed any missing values and duplicates from
the data to ensure data quality. Next, we extracted the relevant information from the "value"
column, which included the show name and watch duration. To further simplify the data, we
summed the watch duration for each show. This allowed us to determine which shows
were the most popular in each sample. Finally, we utilized Tableau, a powerful data visualization
tool, to create clear and easy-to-understand visualizations of the data. By presenting the results in
an accessible manner, we were able to communicate our findings effectively and facilitate better
decision-making.

## Results summary:
Across all data sets, we found that the shows The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,
Vanderpump Rules, The Real Housewives of Atlanta, and Top Chef were the most popular
shows, from most popular to fourth most popular respectively. The Expanse and Mr. Robot
consistently appeared at the bottom of our graphs.

## Conclusion:
The top four shows, Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, Vanderpump Rules, The Real
Housewives of Atlanta, and Top Chef are all reality television shows, showing that the genre is
extremely popular and has widespread appeal. We can conclude that the audience really enjoys
Real Housewives types of shows, however, the housewives who live in Beverly Hills have more
appeal. From the low viewing numbers of Mr. Robot and The Expanse, it can be concluded that
science fiction shows have low appeal.

## Recommendation:
We recommend NBCUniversal to create more reality television shows and create fewer
science fiction shows to maximize viewers.Vanderpump Rules is a spin-off of The Real
Housewives of Beverly Hills, which shows that the Real Housewives brand is extremely strong.
We believe that creating more Real Housewives television shows or spin-offs of the series would
be extremely successful. We would also suggest creating fewer science fiction shows as they
seem to gain fewer viewers than other genres
